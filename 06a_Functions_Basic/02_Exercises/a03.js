/*
Task: Mark Tool for linear grade calculation
a) Program a function that determines a grade based
on the achieved points with a linear grade scale. The formula is
     Grade = (points achieved / max points) * 5 + 1
b) Add a text to the grade as follows:
If the grade is >= 4.0, then the grade is 'sufficient',
otherwise 'unsatisfactory'.
c) Implement the tool user friendly, i.e.

Î» node a03-A.js
